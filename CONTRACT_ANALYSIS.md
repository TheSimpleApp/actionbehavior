**Event Date:** February 27-28, 2026  
**Budget:** $6,000  
**Client:** Action Behavior Centers

## 🎯 Key Insights

### This is a V2 UPDATE Project

**NOT** a new build from scratch:
- Updating existing Flutter/Firebase app from 2024
- App already approved in App Store
- Building on proven V1 architecture
- User base already exists

### BUT You're Choosing Different Tech

**Contract Specifies:** Flutter + Firebase  
**You're Building:** React Native + Supabase

**Why You're Right:**
- Data exports (top priority) easier with PostgreSQL
- AI-assisted coding better with React/TypeScript
- Admin panel easier (same Next.js stack)
- Faster development with Claude Max + Cursor Ultra
- Better outcomes for client

## 🔥 Top Pain Points from 2024 (Must Fix in 2025)

### #1 Data Exports Were Unreliable
**Problem:** Incomplete, truncated, or inaccessible exports  
**Solution:** Comprehensive CSV exports using PostgreSQL → CSV

### #2 No Admin Control
**Problem:** All content updates required developer  
**Solution:** Full admin panel for self-service management

### #3 Manual Roommate Pairing
**Problem:** Time-consuming manual process  
**Solution:** Fully automated algorithm with admin override

### #4 Rushed Timeline
**Problem:** Compressed development schedule  
**Solution:** 8x longer timeline (10 months vs. 6 weeks)
